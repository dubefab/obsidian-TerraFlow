## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This theme blends utility and calm aesthetics:

- **Color hierarchy**: Inspired by Claude’s interface, with soft oranges, greys, and neutral backdrops
- **Minimal noise**: Reduced borders and visual clutter
- **Thoughtful depth**: Shadow styles (`--shadow-xs` to `--shadow-xl`) give components a layered feel
- **Accessible interaction**: Clean outlines and active states improve keyboard navigation and usability

## 📐 Customization Tips

You can modify the following easily:
- Headings: `--h1-color`, `--h2-color`, ...
- Shadows: `--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`, ...
- Radius: `--radius-lg`, `--radius-xl`, ...
- Accent: `--interactive-accent`, `--checkbox-color`, ...

The file is heavily commented to help guide edits.
